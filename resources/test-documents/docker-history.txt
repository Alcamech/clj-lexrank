In 2008, Solomon Hykes founded dotCloud to build a language-agnostic platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering. The
language-agnostic aspect was the unique selling point for dotCloud—existing PaaSs were tied to particular sets of languages
(e.g., Heroku supported Ruby, and Google App Engine supported Java and Python). In 2010, dotCloud took part in Y Combinator’s
accelerator program, where it was exposed to new partners and began to attract serious investment. Some companies might
have been reluctant to make such as decision (who wants to give away their magic beans), but the major turning point came
in March 2013 when dotCloud recognized that Docker would benefit enormously from becoming a community-driven project.
Early versions of Docker were little more than a wrapper around LXC paired with a union filesystem, but the uptake and
speed of development was shockingly fast. Within six months, it had more than 6,700 stars on GitHub and 175 nonemployee
contributors. This led dotCloud to change its name to Docker, Inc., and to refocus its business model. Docker 1.0 was
announced in June 2014, just 15 months after the 0.1 release. Docker 1.0 represented a major jump in stability and
reliability—it was now declared “production ready,” although it had already seen production use in several companies,
including Spotify and Baidu. At the same time, Docker started moving toward being a complete platform rather than just
a container engine, with the launch of the Docker Hub, a public repository for containers. Other companies were quick to
see the potential of Docker. Red Hat became a major partner in September 2013 and started using Docker to power its OpenShift
cloud offering. Google, Amazon, and DigitalOcean were quick to offer Docker support on their clouds, and several startups
began specializing in Docker hosting, such as Stack Dock. In October 2014, Microsoft announced that future versions of
Windows Server would support Docker, representing a huge shift in positioning for a company traditionally associated
with bloated enterprise software. DockerConEU in December 2014 saw the announcement of Docker Swarm, a clustering manager
for Docker and Docker Machine, a command-line interface (CLI) tool for provisioning Docker hosts. This was a clear signal
of Docker’s intention to provide a complete and integrated solution for running containers and not allowing themselves to
be restricted to only providing the Docker engine. That same December, CoreOS announced the development of rkt, its own container
runtime, and the development of the appc container specification. In June 2015, during DockerCon in San Francisco, Solomon
Hykes from Docker and Alex Polvi from CoreOS announced the formation of the Open Container Initiative (then called the Open Container Project)
to develop a common standard for container formats and runtimes. Then, in June 2015, the FreeBSD project announced that
Docker was now supported on FreeBSD, using ZFS and the Linux compatibility layer. In August 2015, Docker and Microsoft
released a “tech preview” of the Docker Engine for Windows server. With the release of Docker 1.8, Docker introduced the
content trust feature, which verifies the integrity and publisher of Docker images. Content trust is a critical component
for building trusted workflows based on images retrieved from Docker registries.
