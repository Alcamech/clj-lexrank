In this blog post, we will walk you through the different steps that are necessary to get you started with Docker Compose and show you how to use it. To demonstrate the benefits of Docker Compose, we will create a simple Node.js "Hello World" application, which will run on 3 Docker Node.js containers. HTTP requests will be distributed to these Node.js nodes by an HAProxy instance running on another Docker container. Compose is a tool used to define and run complex applications with Docker. With compose, you can define a multicontainer application in a single file and then spin your application up in a single command, which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.
